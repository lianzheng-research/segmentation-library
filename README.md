| ICLR 2023 <br> Outstanding Paper | VTM | Universal Few-Shot Learning of Dense Prediction Tasks with Visual Token Matching [paper](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=88nT0j5jAn) [code](https://github.com/GitGyun/visual_token_matching) | VTM is the first universal few-shot learner for arbitrary dense prediction task. It employs non-parametric matching on patch-level embedded tokens of images and labels within a hierarchical encoder-decoder architecture that is optimized with the standard episodic meta-learning protocol. |
